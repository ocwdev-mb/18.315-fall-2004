description: These lecture notes on hyperplane arrangements are based on a lecture
  series at the Park City Mathematics Institute, July 12-19, 2004. They provide an
  introduction to hyperplane arrangements, focusing on connections with combinatorics,
  at the beginning graduate student level. Background material on posets and matroids
  is included, as well as numerous exercises. After going through these notes a student
  should be ready to study the deeper algebraic and topological aspects of the theory
  of hyperplane arrangements.
