Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Course Information
------------------

About half the course will be based on notes from a previous lecture series. Some of the topics covered in the course involve connections with topology, representation theory, and commutative algebra. Those with insufficient backgrounds in these topics should still be able to follow most of the course.

Textbook
--------

There is no required text, although I have included an extensive {{% resource_link db4a8a5a-f4f9-c606-4548-a31d1683a8f9 "bibliography" %}}.

The main text on hyperplane arrangements is: Orlik, P., and H. Terao. _Arrangements of Hyperplanes._ New York: Springer-Verlag, 1992.

This book has more emphasis on algebra and topology and less on combinatorics than will be presented in the course. There is no real reason to purchase this book for the course, but those who want to look deeper into the subject can do so.

Grading
-------

Grading will be based on problem sets due approximately once every two weeks.
