description: This section provides lecture notes on hyperplane arrangements based
  on a lecture series at the Park City Mathematics Institute, July 12-19, 2004. They
  provide an introduction to hyperplane arrangements, focusing on connections with
  combinatorics, at the beginning graduate student level. Background material on posets
  and matroids is included, as well as numerous exercises. After going through these
  notes a student should be ready to study the deeper algebraic and topological aspects
  of the theory of hyperplane arrangements.

These lecture notes on hyperplane arrangements are based on a lecture series at the Park City Mathematics Institute, July 12-19, 2004. They provide an introduction to hyperplane arrangements, focusing on connections with combinatorics, at the beginning graduate student level. Background material on posets and matroids is included, as well as numerous exercises. After going through these notes a student should be ready to study the deeper algebraic and topological aspects of the theory of hyperplane arrangements. Perhaps someday these notes will be expanded into a textbook on arrangements.
